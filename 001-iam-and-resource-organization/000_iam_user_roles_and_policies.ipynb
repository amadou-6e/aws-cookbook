    "# Starting with AWS: IAM Roles and Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud access should always follow the principle of **least privilege**. Rather than using root or master credentials for daily development or automation tasks, AWS recommends setting up dedicated IAM users, assigning only the permissions they need, and accessing resources via securely managed credentials or role assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the secure setup of AWS IAM for programmatic access using users, groups, policies, and roles. This is the first and most critical step for any team or developer starting with AWS via APIs, SDKs, or the CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also explain the structure of IAM, the AWS authentication model, and prepare a minimal user setup that allows us to continue with the rest of the tutorial series securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- Creating a group with limited permissions (VPC and EC2 admin)\n",
    "- Creating a user assigned to that group\n",
    "- Enabling programmatic access (access key & secret)\n",
    "- Attaching a custom policy or AWS-managed policy\n",
    "- Creating a named profile using the AWS SDKs\n",
    "- Setting up MFA\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS IAM: Identities, Policies, and Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin setup, we need to understand a few key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IAM Users**:  \n",
    "Identities for people or services needing programmatic access (via access keys) or console access (via password).\n",
    "- **IAM Groups**:  \n",
    "Collections of users with shared permissions.\n",
    "- **IAM Policies**:  \n",
    "JSON documents defining permissions (read, write, list, deny, etc.).\n",
    "- **IAM Roles**:  \n",
    "Delegated identities assumed by users, services, or external accounts, often used for temporary credentials and cross-account access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In production-grade setups, you'd avoid long-lived IAM users where possible, and instead rely on:\n",
    "- **Federated login**  \n",
    "  Allows users from external identity providers (like Azure AD or Google Workspace) to access AWS using their existing credentials, without needing IAM users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assumed roles**  \n",
    "  Lets users or services temporarily switch to a role with specific permissions, often used for cross-account access or automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporary credentials**  \n",
    "  Short-lived credentials automatically managed by AWS, issued to federated users or services like EC2 and Lambda via attached roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow these instructions, you must log in to the AWS console using a **root user only once** to perform administrative IAM setup.\n",
    "After that, root credentials should be safely stored and never used for daily operations.\n"
   ]

    "## Using the AWS Console to Set Up IAM Securely\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AWS Management Console** is the web-based interface for managing AWS services. It provides a graphical UI to configure, deploy, and monitor your resources without writing code or using the CLI. All IAM-related actions, users, roles, policies, can be handled within the **IAM** section of the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/pics/000_iam_user_roles_and_policies/aws-console.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"800rem\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the AWS Console [here](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the console, you can use the search functionality to find different resources inside your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the category used to manage authentication and authorization in AWS. You can find it by searching for \"IAM\" in the AWS Console search bar or selecting it from the \"Security, Identity, & Compliance\" category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding IAM Groups, Users, Roles and Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin creating users and assigning permissions in AWS, it’s essential to understand the core identity and access management (IAM) building blocks. These concepts are foundational not just to AWS, but to secure system design in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/pics/000_iam_user_roles_and_policies/users-groups-roles-policies.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"600rem\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IAM Users**    \n",
    "    An IAM user represents a single identity with a unique set of credentials and permissions. This identity can be used to access AWS either via the console (with a username/password) or programmatically (with an access key and secret).\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Analogy**: Think of a user account on a Linux system. Just as each user has a unique ID and credentials to log in and execute commands, an IAM user is a uniquely identifiable entity in your AWS environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    IAM users should be created only when absolutely necessary — typically for developers or automation scripts — and always with the least privilege necessary to do their job.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IAM Groups**    \n",
    "    An IAM group is a collection of users who share the same set of permissions. Policies are attached to groups, not to individual users. Any user added to the group inherits those permissions automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Analogy**: In Microsoft Active Directory (or any corporate directory), users are placed into groups like \"HR\", \"Finance\", or \"IT\", and access is granted at the group level. IAM groups follow the same model — they simplify permission management by applying access rules collectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Groups have no credentials of their own; they simply provide a way to manage permissions efficiently and consistently across users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IAM Roles**  \n",
    "    An IAM role is a temporary identity with specific permissions. Unlike a user, a role has no long-term credentials and is meant to be assumed by users, AWS services, or external identities. AWS automatically issues and rotates the temporary credentials when a role is assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Analogy**: Think of a visitor badge in a secure office. An employee swipes their badge to get in every day, but a guest is given a temporary visitor pass that allows limited access for a short period. IAM roles serve this same purpose: temporary, scoped access without permanent credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Roles are essential for automation (e.g., EC2 instances writing to S3), delegation, and secure cross-account or external access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IAM Policies**    \n",
    "    An IAM policy is a JSON-based document that explicitly defines what actions are allowed or denied on which resources and under what conditions Policies are attached to users, groups, or roles to define their permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Analogy**: In firewall configuration, you define rules like “allow port 22 from IP range X” or “deny all traffic except port 80.” IAM policies work similarly, but for AWS resources: they define rules like “allow starting EC2 instances in us-west-2” or “deny deleting S3 buckets.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    Policies are the fine-grained mechanism by which all AWS access is controlled, and mastering them is critical to secure cloud operation.\n"
